# Classification-with-Random-Forest---2

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to identify risky taxpayers for further investigation. The insights gained can be used to improve tax compliance and revenue collection and also leverages Random Forests to classify taxpayers as "Risky" or "Good" based on their marital status, taxable income, city population, work experience, and urban status. 

To perform this project here we used following steps:
Data Preparation: Loaded the data, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and created the target variable based on a taxable income threshold.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed visual analysis using Seaborn to understand data distributions, relationships, and potential outliers.
Model Building: Built a Random Forest classifier, tuned hyperparameters using grid search, and evaluated the model on a test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
